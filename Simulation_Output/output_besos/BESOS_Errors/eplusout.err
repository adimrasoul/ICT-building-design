   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (2) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Severe  ** WindowMaterial:Glazing="38", Illegal value combination.
   **   ~~~   ** Solar Transmittance at Normal Incidence + Back Side Solar Reflectance at Normal Incidence not <= 1.0
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction PARTIZIONE DI PROGETTO_REV of interzone surface BLOCCO1:CORRIDOIO_PARTITION_2_0_0 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction PARTIZIONE DI PROGETTO of adjacent surface BLOCCO1:ROOM407_PARTITION_4_0_10001
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 2 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   **  Fatal  ** GetSurfaceData: Errors discovered, program terminates.
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=1
   ..... Last severe error=WindowMaterial:Glazing="38", Illegal value combination.
